1. **How to migrate HTML & JavaScript code to ReactJS?**

   **Answer:**
   To migrate HTML and JavaScript code to ReactJS, follow these steps:
   - **Set Up React Environment:** Initialize a new React project using Create React App or any other setup tool.
   - **Component Structure:** Identify distinct sections of your HTML and JavaScript that can be transformed into React components.
   - **Convert HTML to JSX:** Replace HTML with JSX in your React components. Ensure that you adjust syntax issues like class attributes (`class` to `className`), inline styles, and self-closing tags.
   - **State Management:** Convert JavaScript logic related to state and events into React state and event handlers.
   - **Refactor Functions:** Transform your JavaScript functions into React component methods or hooks.
   - **Routing:** If your application has multiple pages, set up React Router to handle navigation.

2. **How to consume already shared messages in Kafka?**

   **Answer:**
   To consume messages that have already been shared in Kafka:
   - **Set Consumer Group:** Configure your Kafka consumer to be part of a consumer group. Kafka maintains offsets per consumer group.
   - **Seek to Offset:** Use the `seek` method on your Kafka consumer to set the offset to the position from which you want to start consuming messages. You can seek to the beginning of the topic or a specific offset.
   - **Configure Consumer Properties:** Ensure your consumer properties are set correctly, such as `auto.offset.reset` (e.g., `earliest` to read from the beginning).

3. **What are your daily roles and responsibilities?**

   **Answer:**
   This answer will vary depending on the role, but generally:
   - **Development:** Writing and maintaining code for various features and fixing bugs.
   - **Collaboration:** Working with cross-functional teams including designers, product managers, and other developers.
   - **Code Reviews:** Participating in code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
   - **Testing:** Writing and running unit tests and integration tests.
   - **Deployment:** Assisting with the deployment of applications and ensuring smooth production operations.

4. **What is the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller` in Spring?**

   **Answer:**
   - **`@Controller`:** Used in Spring MVC to define a controller class. It is used for building web applications and returns views (JSP, Thymeleaf).
   - **`@RestController`:** A specialized version of `@Controller` used for RESTful web services. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning it returns data (usually JSON or XML) directly rather than rendering a view.

5. **What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java?**

   **Answer:**
   - **Method Overloading:** Occurs when multiple methods in a class have the same name but different parameters (different type or number). It is resolved at compile-time.
   - **Method Overriding:** Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is resolved at runtime and must have the same name, return type, and parameters.

6. **What is a thread in Java?**

   **Answer:**
   A thread in Java is a lightweight subprocess that runs concurrently with other threads. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Each thread has its own execution path but shares the same process resources.

7. **How do you handle exceptions in a `Runnable` since it cannot throw checked exceptions?**

   **Answer:**
   Since `Runnable` does not allow throwing checked exceptions, handle exceptions within the `run` method using a `try-catch` block. Log or manage the exception as needed:

   ```java
   public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       @Override
       public void run() {
           try {
               // Code that might throw an exception
           } catch (Exception e) {
               // Handle the exception
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

8. **What are the differences between `Callable` and `Runnable` in Java?**

   **Answer:**
   - **`Runnable`:** Represents a task that can be executed by a thread. It does not return a result and cannot throw checked exceptions.
   - **`Callable`:** Similar to `Runnable`, but it can return a result and can throw checked exceptions. It has a `call` method that returns a value and may throw exceptions.

9. **What is the difference between `wait()` and `sleep()` methods in Java?**

   **Answer:**
   - **`wait()`:** Called on an object’s monitor to release the lock and wait until notified. It is used for inter-thread communication and requires synchronization.
   - **`sleep()`:** A static method of the `Thread` class that pauses the thread for a specified time but does not release the lock on any object.

10. **Can you explain the thread life cycle in Java?**

    **Answer:**
    The thread life cycle consists of:
    - **New:** The thread is created but not yet started.
    - **Runnable:** The thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
    - **Blocked:** The thread is waiting to acquire a lock or resource.
    - **Waiting:** The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
    - **Timed Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a specified period.
    - **Terminated:** The thread has completed execution or terminated.

11. **What is a thread pool in Java and how does it work?**

    **Answer:**
    A thread pool is a collection of reusable threads that are used to perform multiple tasks. It reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction by reusing existing threads. The `ExecutorService` interface in Java provides a way to manage thread pools, using classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`.

12. **What are the differences between Spring MVC and Spring Boot?**

    **Answer:**
    - **Spring MVC:** A framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Requires configuration for setting up the application.
    - **Spring Boot:** A framework that simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications. It provides auto-configuration, embedded servers, and a convention-over-configuration approach, allowing for rapid development.

13. **How do you join two tables in SQL? Provide an example query.**

    **Answer:**
    To join two tables in SQL, you use the `JOIN` clause. For example, to join `employees` and `departments` tables:

    ```sql
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, d.department_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```

14. **Write a Java code snippet to find the top element in a mountain array.**

    **Answer:**

    ```java
    public class MountainArrayTop {

        public static int findTopElement(int[] arr) {
            int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
            while (left <= right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]) {
                    return arr[mid];
                } else if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            return -1; // should not reach here if input is a valid mountain array
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int[] mountainArray = {1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2};
            System.out.println("Top element: " + findTopElement(mountainArray));
        }
    }
    ```

    **Example:**
    - **Input:** `[1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 2]`
    - **Output:** `12`

15. **Which technologies have you worked with, and how have you utilized them in your projects?**

    **Answer:**
    This question is specific to your experience and will vary. Here’s an example structure:
    - **ReactJS:** Used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
    - **Spring Boot:** Utilized for creating RESTful APIs and microservices.
    - **Kafka:** Implemented for handling real-time data streams and message processing.
    - **Docker/Kubernetes:** Deployed and managed containerized applications for scalable and consistent environments.
